## Build and manage `theme.json` with `merge-theme`

This theme uses a modular approach for `theme.json`, splitting it into multiple files inside the `theme-config/` directory. To generate the final `theme.json` file, follow these steps:

### ðŸš€ Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
If you havenâ€™t already, install the required Node.js dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### ðŸ”„ Merge theme.json Files
Run the following command to combine all JSON files into a single theme.json:

```sh
npm run merge-theme
```

This script automatically merges all settings, styles, and templates from the theme-config/ folder into the final theme.json file, which is required for WordPress to function properly.

### ðŸ“Œ When to Run merge-theme
âœ… After modifying any file inside theme-config/

âœ… Before committing changes to ensure theme.json is up to date

âœ… Before testing the theme in a WordPress environment

### ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

If the command doesnâ€™t work:

ðŸ”¹ Ensure you are running it from the themeâ€™s root directory

ðŸ”¹ Check if Node.js and npm are installed by running:

```sh
node -v && npm -v
```

ðŸ”¹ Try deleting node_modules and reinstalling dependencies:
```sh
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

Now youâ€™re ready to manage theme.json more efficiently! ðŸš€
